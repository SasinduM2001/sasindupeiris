Main Function
Started coding with headers(stdio.h) and included argument counter and argument variable, 
Then created a file handle variable. 
Imported text file and source selected as command line argument.
Created if statement to print file open failure. 
These were the first steps of coding. The next step was counting words function.
Calling functions was challenging, I tried several times by changing the way I used them and on most occasions tried using global variables and global functions. So, I assigned each and every function to a single variable and used it whenever I wanted. 
But it was not working. Then I used fseek to fix that and later on I changed it to rewise. Then it worked properly.

Int wordcount function
Created function as int and passed parameters of file handle to use it in this function.
Created character, wordcounter, and word variables.
The purpose of creating character variables is to put characters after reading the text file.
Wordcounter is to count words.
The word variable is to put successful word find while reading the text file.
Created a while loop and it reads the file using fgetc function reading each and every character of the text file until it ends(EOF).
Used isspace to read all whitespaces, but somehow the text file includes words separated without spaces and with commas or dots, I have to read them also. So, while statement includes them too.
Used this C Program to Count Characters, Words and Lines in a File - QnA Plus website using searching on Google to find this way. For the rest of this function, I followed that method.
I have commented the process of that function in the code.

Int frequency function
Created function as usual. 
Followed steps of https://youtu.be/1OZMcC0euic?si=9VmeCdjC5MFN7yMR this video. But it says it for use in strings. So, I used those steps and converted that method for use it in text file. I used only what I needed, Such as, in video it calculate percentage of each character. I did not use that. 



Substring Function
I used these references to do this upto some point. But I had to change it several times because It didn’t give any output. Then after I used the https://youtu.be/yvquaNW5IpQ?list=PLkjV_9KOeOj86KQwz-SeRSROZGPUpqiCV&t=338  this way to fix it.

Reverse function 

used this method to do this. Also, the code we wrote in the last assignment(Pointers) helped to do. 
Challenges – In here in the while loop, I had to keep a character space for a null character. 
I realized that after watching this video - https://youtu.be/yvquaNW5IpQ?list=PLkjV_9KOeOj86KQwz-SeRSROZGPUpqiCV&t=338


Reversesame Function(PALINDROME)
reverse same - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-check-given-string-palindrome/
used this method to do. But I had to convert the method to read and write it to use in file reading.
